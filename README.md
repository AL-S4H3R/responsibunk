# A simple tool that helps to manage your online class bunks(aka missing classes).

Uses the browsers local storage for the data. Will soon be converted to a cloud based tool on the next major release.

# Mess around with the code, and contribute something. Will be more than happy. Till then, keep skipping class and build something.
